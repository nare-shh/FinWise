AI Powered Tax Optimization
In India, navigating the income tax system
is complex, time-consuming, and often
confusing for the average taxpayer. With
frequent policy changes, numerous
deductions under multiple sections (like
80C, 80D, etc.), and the choice between
the old and new tax regimes, individuals
and small businesses struggle to make
optimal financial decisions.
